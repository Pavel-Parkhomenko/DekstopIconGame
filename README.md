>> A mini-game in which you will have to match your desktop icons to their original position.

### Features:
- The number of icons is equal to their number on your desktop (with the exception of some).
- The background picture is your picture from the theme you used.

### Management:
- Mouse (I think you'll figure it out) and space bar (restart).

### Platform:
- Linux Debian Gnome
- Kernel version 6.1.0 - 31 - amd64

### Important:
>> The game only works on Linux Debian, as it uses links to some system files
